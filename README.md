#High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Strategy with RSI and ATR

This repository houses a TradingView algorithmic strategy script for high-frequency trading. The strategy utilizes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for determining market entry signals, and Average True Range (ATR) for setting stop-loss and take-profit points.

The script also adjusts its thresholds dynamically based on market volatility for optimized trading performance.

Strategy Overview

The strategy works on the following key principles:

Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator is used to generate the buy and sell signals for the strategy.
Average True Range (ATR): The ATR is used as a tool for measuring volatility and for setting stop-loss and take-profit points.
Dynamic Thresholds: These thresholds are calculated using standard deviation to manage market volatility and produce precise buy and sell signals.
Stop Loss and Take Profit Mechanisms: The ATR value is used to set the stop-loss and take-profit points.
